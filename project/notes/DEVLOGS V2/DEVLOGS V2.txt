/// DEVLOG v2 For new version of this inventory system ///

TOPIC ONE : ds_grid[# unreadable numbers] -> ds_list[ <<struct>>]
	
	... read the "why is there new version ongoing" note for reason
	
	i soon realised it's much better to have written it in struct into ds_list ..
	well .. like this
```
	ds_list [| item_in_slot]
	item_in_slot = {
		item_index, 
		amount,
		favourite,
		
	// I can even add more without having to remember which number for which feature.

	}
```
	which would allow me to call it easier and (very important), readable
	
	ds_list[| selected_slot].item_index.use();
	ds_list[| selected_slot].amount--;
	ds_list[| selected_slot].favourite = true;
	etc ...
}

TOPIC TWO : interaction state
	
	v1 is handled with tons of if nests and globalvar mouse_inv WHICH DECLARED in cont_inventory
	so bad, much cringe
	
>> how do i fix this?
	
	<< state machine >>
	where we have step handle which state is on
	and the we call state.step
	
	like this
	(just imagine states init by ourselves)
	
	step event: 
	
	input.check_pressed(mb_left, shift)		state = move_all
	input.check_pressed(mb_right, shift)	state = move_one
	input.check_pressed(mb_left)			state = mouse_get_all
	input.check_pressed(mb_right)			state = mouse_get_half

	state.step();
	
	u see, cleaner and better, yay
	
	i should sleep
