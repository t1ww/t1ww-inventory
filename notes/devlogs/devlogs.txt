// 3/1/2023 : just started the project (planning)
// 16/4/2023 : most systems are done, creating inv, adding items, 
	mouse interaction ( leftclick, rightclick + shift), drawing items on inventory and mouse.
	.. expanding inventory is not working rn.
	.. still no shift clicking for leftclick.
	.. unused functions (not properly at least); drop, remove, use(need to be done)
todo > ...
	.. resize inventory function, need to change how they draw / handle size, width ,and height variables
	.. use checking functions to assists reading in ifs statements ( and easier to change )
	.. deal with drop and remove functions to make the system use it properly and consistently
// 19/4/2023
	adjusting how mouse interacts with item outside inventory 
	mouse lclick ; drop all > use
	mouse rclick ; drop1 > drop all
todo > --- still the same from 16/4/2023

// 04 / 01 / 2024 : 1:33am
	fuck i didnt keep track for what i did
- recalling
	i fixed the in area by completely remake it iirc
	i reorganized most of the code, separated it into different objects
	global mouse now doesnt use with (it doesnt need to)
	i did chest and market
	i did prepare shift left click for quick transfer ( its currently does nothing )
	i also add new unstackable item (hat) -> breaks
	
// 04 / 01 / 2024 : 1:52am
	i added notes and re-organized the items setup codes with some comment
	should help with the future workflow and less confusing
	
// 11 / 01 / 2024 : 2:18pm
	the stacking is broken
	doing the save and load, still cant load the grid
	type limit block mouse from grabbing the item back
	// : 2:18pm
	can save the grid now (thanks to FrostyCat's grid_to_struct(grid) function)

// 12 / 01 / 2024 : 3:02pm
	fixed stacking
	fixed type limit
	stock in market now reduced when bought
	stock doesnt come back by selling the item
	
// 08 / 02 / 2024 : 2:21pm
	something is wrong with inventory after i load it
	same items sometimes swaps instead of stacking
	and the items doesnt get removed after using all of it from the stack and gets through -1
	it seems like the item index is wrong, will have to recheck
