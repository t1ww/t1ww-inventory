create an inventory list using ds_grid(xsize = 10, ysize = 1, element[item, amount])
///inside inventorySystem object
//inventory interaction
+shift {
	left click, transfer all to other inventory
}
+ctrl {
	left click, delete all of that stack (put in trash bin slot)
	right click, delete one of that stack
}
// dropped item
	stores item, amount
	if touch player) add item to inventory; delete self;
///saveAndLoad object
//save and load the inventory


// 13 / 10 / 2023 : new current plan
- mouse state machine -> might not do this anymore?
	- mouse empty
	- mouse holding item
	- mouse quick equip
	- mouse quick store (chest)
	
- equipment system -> kind of did this
	- item.equip();
	- item.unequip();
	
- save and load the inventory -> doing this; 11/1/2024

- maybe add buy back list, it currently only stores one latest sold
